# Customer Reviews Analysis with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and STV Voting Method

This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze customer reviews, providing insights and sentiment analysis. The implementation includes an STV (Single Transferable Vote) voting method to improve classification results by combining predictions from multiple models. 

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies customer reviews into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements traditional ML algorithms like Random Forest and SVM.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes neural networks, such as LSTMs or CNNs, for deeper textual understanding.
- **STV Voting**: Combines outputs from multiple models to achieve higher accuracy and robustness.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes graphical representations of insights extracted from customer reviews.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
