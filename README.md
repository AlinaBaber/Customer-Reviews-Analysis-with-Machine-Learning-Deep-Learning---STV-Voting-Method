## Project Workflow
# Customer Reviews Analysis with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and STV Voting Method

This project is designed to analyze and classify customer reviews into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral. It combines advanced data analysis techniques with state-of-the-art algorithms to derive meaningful insights from textual feedback, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Key Components of the Project

### Data Preprocessing
- The project starts by cleaning and preparing the customer review data.
- This involves:
  - Text cleaning (removal of special characters, stop words, etc.).
  - Tokenization.
  - Transforming text data into numerical formats like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

### Model Training
- Multiple models are trained to analyze sentiments:
  - **Machine Learning Models**: Algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression are used for traditional sentiment classification.
  - **Deep Learning Models**: Neural network architectures such as LSTM (for sequence data) and CNNs (for feature extraction) are applied for more nuanced analysis of customer reviews.

### STV (Single Transferable Vote) Voting Method
- Instead of relying on a single model, the project integrates predictions from multiple models using the STV voting method.
- This approach ensures that the final sentiment classification is more robust, combining the strengths of various models to mitigate individual weaknesses.

### Evaluation Metrics
- The performance of individual models and the ensemble voting system is evaluated using metrics like:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**

### Visualization
- The project generates visual representations of the results, such as:
  - Sentiment distribution across the dataset.
  - Comparative performance metrics for each model.
  - Insights into frequently used words or phrases in customer reviews.

### Results
- By leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble techniques, the project achieves higher accuracy and better reliability than using standalone models.
- This demonstrates the effectiveness of combining traditional and modern AI approaches for text analysis.

## Applications
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understand customer sentiments to improve services or products.
- **Business Decision Support**: Use insights for strategic planning based on customer opinions.
- **Marketing Analytics**: Identify trends and public sentiment about brands or products.
